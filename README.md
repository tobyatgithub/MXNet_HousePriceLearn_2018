### **General**  
This is the notebook I used for the Kaggle [House Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) challenge using XGBoost and Gluon trainer.

### **Content**
There's four notebooks, two of them are pre-processing, and two of them are modeling.
1. finding missing values
2. finding outliers
3. XGBoost modeling
4. Gluon trainer modeling.

### **Reference**
Here's some notebooks and documents that I found very insightful and helpful during the process. Overall, I found Kaggle to be an extremely helpful resource for studying machine learning. Not only because of many challenges and data sets it has, but also because numerous interesting notebook people share on it.
